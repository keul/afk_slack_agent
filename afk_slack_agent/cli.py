    This command can be run as an agent or as a client.

    \b
    As an agent (-a), it will:
    - Capture your lock screen activation/deactivation and communicate them to Slack
    - Listen for messages from the client

    Using the client is optional. Agent can be used to send messages to the agent, to perform
    actions and run commands on your computer.

    Configuring action is done by editing the .afk.json file in your home directory.
    The file will be created the first time you run the agent.
